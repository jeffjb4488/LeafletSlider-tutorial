                <p class="lorem">During the Michigan’s lockdown responses to COVID-19 pandemic, beginning on March 16, 2020 Lansing foodservice workers and business owners have faced many challenges, including: health concerns, shutdowns, restricted hours, occupancy limits, poor delivery infrastructure, economic slowdowns, supply-chain issues, and customer hesitancy. Dozens of businesses in the Greater Lansing area have closed permanently or temporarily during the pandemic (Kaminski and Stocken 2020), as Michigan’s foodservice industry faced record financial losses during the months-long dine-in ban and capacity restrictions (Couch and Greco 2020).</p>

                <p class="lorem">Indeed, a survey of Michigan restaurants in April 2020 indicated that nearly four-percent would have to permanently close within the month. Hardest hit were businesses without large savings (Couch and Greco 2020) or established delivery or drive-through services (Couch 2020). Occasionally community members organized support for local businesses, but these were rare, feel good stories in a narrative defined by sale deficits of 50 - 75% where pandemic restrictions were exacerbated by mass unemployment and significant changes in work routines (Couch 2020; Greco 2020).</p>

                <p class="lorem">This map includes Lansing area 15 restaurants, bars, and coffee shops that closed permanently during the pandemic, from March 2020 - August 2021. While each business faced unique circumstances that prompted their closings, all were connected to the broader narrative of the impacts of the pandemic on the foodservice industry in Michigan.</p>

                <p class="lorem">Use the slider in the top right corner of the map to visualize when each business closed, some went out of business in the first weeks of the lockdown, while others stuck it out for months. Click on any of the 15 businesses to read about their specific circumstances derived from owner interviews and official social media posts. In this narrative, the voices of non-owner foodservice workers are missing and was not something broadly accessible at this time.</p>

You really do.”',

Since 2011, we have valued our special relationship with the Downtown Lansing community. Unfortunately, the impact of COVID-19 has temporarily dampened the normal vibrancy of downtown. Because of this, we will need to put a "pause" on our operations here. We hope to return to serving our loyal downtown guests with our comfort foods, sandwiches, salads, soups, and of course, our Michigan-sourced handmade pies in 2021. Our East Lansing and Okemos shops are still open for carryout, curbside takeout, delivery, and catering. We hope to see you there.”',
